## Course work for HSE 2nd year

Use 'make all' to compile everything.

graphcrunch has everyting you need, graphdump is outdated

currently supports only YUM-style repositories (.hdlist info files) import and .dot file export

type help in graphcrunch to see more info

first load a parser and an exporter, then load file

proper readme when this program will have proper interface
